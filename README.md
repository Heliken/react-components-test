## Comments
1. Using icons with "use xlink" seems like not the best option for styled-components, but sadly didn't had time to rework it.
2. Added basic hover effects since they werent provided in design.
3. Added small state interactions to task.
4. Table isn't pixel perfect for reusability reasons.
